# Introduction
These are my solutions for the assignments of the course 'Current Programming Languages and Paradigms'. These assignemts are taken from two source books of the course:
- [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks/)
- [Seven More Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/titles/7lang/seven-more-languages-in-seven-weeks/)

Out of 14 languages discussed in the books, we reviewed 7:
- Ruby
- Scala
- Elm
- Julia
- Clojure
- Lua
- IO

These languages cover a wide range of paradigms such as object-oriented, functional, and procedural.
